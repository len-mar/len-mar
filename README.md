## Welcome! 
## I'm Marlene, a fresh Java Dev who's all about the learning curve. May it never flatten.
### Skills in: Java | JavaScript | Spring Boot | Git | QA | Agile
----------------
### About me:

🧠 Have always been fascinated by **how** things work, especially **humans and technology**.

👩🏼‍💻 After 4+ years of experience in the software development industry, learning how to code seemed like the logical next step.

🔎 Currently **looking for junior-level roles**, preferrably remote. If you're interested, let me know!


📍 Located in Erfurt, Germany.

### So!

🔭 Feel free to peruse - **comments and feedback** are much appreciated!

🌱 I’m currently learning more about **advanced programming concepts & the extended Java ecosystem.**

💡 So, if you have an impulse or an interesting resource on that or something different, hit me up!


🌞 Otherwise, **thank you for visiting - and enjoy the rest of your day**!
