## Welcome!

### About me:

🧠 Have always been fascinated by **how** things work, especially **humans and technology**.

👩🏼‍💻 After 4+ years of experience in the software development industry, learning how to code seemed like the logical next step.

🔎 Currently **looking for junior-level roles**, preferrably remote. If you're interested, let me know!


📍 Located in Erfurt, Germany.
