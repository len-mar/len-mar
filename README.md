## Hi! I'm Marlene, a fresh Java dev who's all about the learning curve. May it never flatten.
### Skills in: Java | SpringBoot | JavaScript | Git | QA | Agile | more on the way.
----------------

### About me:

🧠 Have always been fascinated by **how** things work, especially **humans and technology**.

👩🏼‍💻 After **4+ years of experience** in the software development industry, learning how to code seemed like the logical next step.

🦆 Luckily, I found **I love(d) coding**. Not all the time, but overall.

📍 Located in Erfurt, Germany.


----------------

🔎 Currently **looking for junior-level development roles**, preferrably remote. If you're interested, let me know!

----------------

### So! Since you're here now...

🔭 Feel free to peruse - **comments and feedback** are much appreciated!

🌱 I’m currently learning more about **advanced programming concepts & the extended Java ecosystem.**

💡 So, if you have an impulse or an interesting resource on that or something different, hit me up!
